# Lyrical Landscapes: Charting the Thematic Journey of American Country Music from 1970 to 2022
## Summary
In this project, we perform topic modeling on a temporal country music lyrics dataset in order to determine if country music reflects societal changes in America from 1970 to 2022.

Our hypothesis is as follows:
Over the period from 1970 to 2022, country music lyrics have shown a significant shift in thematic content, moving from traditional themes of rural life, love, and hardship to more contemporary issues like social change, technology, and urban experiences. This shift can be quantitatively measured using topic modeling and trend analysis techniques.

We **confirm our hypothesis, citing the fact that the prevalence of songs about everyday life decreases about 0.1% on average from 1970 to 2022, while the prevalence songs about nightlife, as well as violence increase (by about 0.15% and 0.1%, respectively) over the same time period.**
